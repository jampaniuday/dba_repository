Migrating to ASM Using RMAN

The following method shows how a primary database can be migrated to ASM from a disk based backup:
Disable change tracking (only available in Enterprise Edition) if it is currently being used.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE DISABLE BLOCK CHANGE TRACKING;
Shutdown the database.
SQL> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
Modify the parameter file of the target database as follows:
Set the DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST and DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_n parameters to the relevant ASM disk groups.
Remove the CONTROL_FILES parameter from the spfile so the control files will be moved to the DB_CREATE_* destination and the spfile gets updated automatically. If you are using a pfile the CONTROL_FILES parameter must be set to the appropriate ASM files or aliases.

Start the database in nomount mode.
RMAN> STARTUP NOMOUNT
Restore the controlfile into the new location from the old location.
RMAN> RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM 'old_control_file_name';
Mount the database.
RMAN> ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
Copy the database into the ASM disk group.
RMAN> BACKUP AS COPY DATABASE FORMAT '+disk_group';
Switch all datafile to the new ASM location.
RMAN> SWITCH DATABASE TO COPY;
Open the database.
RMAN> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
Create new redo logs in ASM and delete the old ones.

Enable change tracking if it was being used.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE ENABLE BLOCK CHANGE TRACKING;
